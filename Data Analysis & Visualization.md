## Conclusion:
In conclusion, we studied the market of coffee chains in the U.S. The findings and recommendations that follow from our analyses are summarized here.

When exploring the overall coffee consumers in the U.S as per their age group, we found that people in the age group 60 and above were the highest consumers of coffee. On the contrary, we found that Starbucks had visitors in the age group of 18-29 years, while people in the age group of 30-49 years preferred Dunkin’ Donuts. There can be many factors behind the variation of coffee choices amongst age group, like- Starbucks must have chains more accessible to the college campuses becoming a favorite place for young crowds, or the choice of coffee that Starbucks offered to attract the young generation. Whereas, if people from 30-49 age prefer Dunkin’ Donuts leads us to questions like- are these chains located in the proximity of work places more than other chains, is the choice of beverages offered targets to this age group, or even the pricing of the products sometime may be taken into consideration. Thus, a recommendation can only be offered considering these points too.

We also investigated the top preferences of beverages sold by a coffee chain, and we found that Coffee was the number one preference followed by espresso and then tea. To see the dynamics of these products across the states of U.S we plotted the profits of the coffee chain product wise across the map. Our analysis provided insight to the diversity of choices across the different states. Coffee drinks is highly preferred in Massachusetts while Nevada do not. The coffee chain scored profits from California and Illinois but was in losses in New Hampshire for Espresso drinks. On the contrary Iowa consumed tea more than any other states. But only on the basis of these data, it is hard to conclude what the population of the states preferred. Factor like- other coffee houses competing this coffee chain, people preferred their beverages from other joints, location of the considered coffee chains, age-group of the visitors visiting the coffee chain, ethnicity of the visitors visiting the coffee chain; must also be considered before making any decisions
These hints should provide sufficient resource for decision makers to consider other factors affecting their sales too.
